#MPG Multiple Linear Regression Analysis
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

#Suspension Coil Summary Statistics
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification? Why or why not?

#Suspension Coil T-Test
Interpretration and findings for the t-test results

#Performance Comparison of the MechaCar Prototype Vehicle to Comparable Vehicles on the Market
In your study design, be sure to write about the following considerations:
Study Design:
Think critically about what metrics you would think would be of interest to a consumer (cost, fuel efficiency, color options, etc.).
Determine what question we would ask, what the null and alternative hypothesis would be to answer that question, and what statistical test could be used to test this hypothesis.
Knowing what test should be used, what data should be collected?
